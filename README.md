# Description
SAO with a simple arcade game similar to the classic Cyclone. Made to run on an ESP32-C3 and to interface with [Neopixel rings](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1463#technical-details).

# How to Play
## Attract Mode
A rotating purple LED on the outer ring and a slow blink of green on the inner ring is the default state
The SAO waits for a button press to transition to START_GAME

## Start Game
Resets the chasing light and randomly selects one of the LEDs to act as the target
Displays the jackpot briefly with a blue color. Immediately transitions to PLAY_GAME

## Play Game
A single lit LED moves around the outer ring.
The goal is to press the button when the active LED is over the previously displayed target LED

## Result
If the button is pressed when the active LED is on the target, itâ€™s a win animation of flashing green
Otherwise, a lose animation of flashing red
After the animation the SAO returns to ATTRACT_MODE
